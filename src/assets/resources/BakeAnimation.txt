STEP 1: Select the Armature

    Go to Object Mode (press Tab if you’re not in Object Mode).

    Right-click the Armature (the skeleton) — it’s usually named something like Armature, mixamorig, or Armature.001.

✅ STEP 2: Enter Pose Mode

    With the Armature selected, press Tab to enter Pose Mode.

    Select the bone you want to bake, for example mixamorig:Hips (or press A to select all bones).

✅ STEP 3: Open the "Bake Action" Tool

    In the top-left corner of Blender, find the "Object" menu.
    You’ll see this change when in Pose Mode — now it's "Pose" instead.

    Click on Pose > Animation > Bake Action


    (This is where it is in Pose Mode.)

OR:

    Press F3 (Search), type Bake Action, and click on it.

✅ STEP 4: Bake Settings Window Appears

Fill the options like this:
Option	What to do
Frame Start / End	Set to your animation range (e.g., 1 - 32)
✅ Only Selected Bones	Check it (if you're baking just some bones)
✅ Visual Keying	✅ Must be ON — it records what you see
❌ Clear Constraints	Turn OFF unless you want to delete them
❌ Clear Parents	Keep OFF
✅ Overwrite Current Action	(Optional) overwrite existing keyframes

Then press OK.
✅ STEP 5: Confirm It Worked

    Open the Dope Sheet or Graph Editor.

    You’ll see that Blender added a keyframe on every frame (within your selected range).

    These are now baked raw keyframes, so modifiers like "Cyclic" or "Linear Extrapolation" are no longer needed — the motion is preserved.

✅ STEP 6: Export Your FBX

    Select the Armature in Object Mode.

    Go to File > Export > FBX (.fbx).

    In the right panel, configure:

Under Include:

    ✅ Limit to > Selected Objects (check this)

    ✅ Object Types: Armature, Mesh

Under Transform:

    Apply scale if needed (Apply Scalings: FBX Units Scale)

Under Bake Animation:

    ✅ Bake Animation (should be checked)

    ❌ NLA Strips (UNcheck this)

    ❌ All Actions (UNcheck this if you only want current action)

Then click Export FBX.
